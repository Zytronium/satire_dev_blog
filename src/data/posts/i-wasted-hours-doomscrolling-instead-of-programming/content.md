In the middle of programming, my phone vibrated. I checked the notification 
and got instantly sucked into doomscrolling on Reddit, as you do. But I couldn't
stop. I kept doomscrolling and doomscrolling and just couldn't stop myself. 
When I finally looked up and checked the time, I saw that an entire hour had 
passed. I had completely forgotten what feature I was in the middle of adding to
the website. I completely lost track of what I was doing. My memory went blank
and I couldn't remember what I was trying to accomplish before. I still can't
remember what I was doing. My mind just went completely blank as for what I was
previously doing. I just blanked out. I couldn't remember for the life of me what
I was doing before I started doomscrolling. I seriously have no clue what I was
trying to do. I don't even remember what I was looking at on Reddit, let alone
what I was attempting to program into my website. I can't even ask my AI assistant
what I was doing because I didn't take notes on what I had planned, and since I 
use Linux, Copilot wasn't there to save the day with all the information it got
from spying on me before I started doomscrolling.

But anyway, I have no clue how I could've possibly forgotten what I was trying
to program. I just totally wiped my memory, like clearing a harddrive. I feel
like I was brainwashed by big tech. Wait a minute... did big tech intentionally
make me start doomscrolling and forget everything? Did big tech brain wash me?
Is big tech trying to stop be from becoming big tech? Did big tech actually
cause brain damage brain damage brain damage ?? Brian damag

Am going to sue big tech for uuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
