Historians rarely discuss it, but George Washington was an early adopter of
systems programming and web development. In fact, Washington himself made

## The Revolutionary Compiler

Washington's first act as Commander-in-Chief was to compile the nation's first
website with zero unsafe blocks.  
He famously declared, *"Give me memory safety or give me death."*

When the Continental Congress tried to build with JavaScript, Washington quickly
noticed there were no types, and, worse, everything was async. Some
criticize him for not switching to TypeScript, but you must keep in mind that
he was a product of his era; Washington lived long before TypeScript ever existed.

He wrote in his field diary:

> “I cannot, in good conscience, await liberty as a promise. Liberty must be 
returned synchronously.”

## The Crossing of the Delaware (in Debug Mode)

On that cold night, Washington used Rust’s strict borrow checker to ensure no soldier double-used a musket pointer.  
Historians claim he yelled:
> “For every mutable reference, there shall be but one!”

The Hessians never stood a chance; they were still resolving merge conflicts in their monorepo.

## Modern Lessons

Rust teaches us what Washington already knew:
- A strong nation, like a strong program, avoids data races.
- Unchecked promises lead to chaos.
- And if your TypeScript build fails, blame King George.

So next time your JavaScript throws at runtime, remember:  
**George Washington would have written it in Rust.**
