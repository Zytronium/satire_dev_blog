I use AI for everything I do, and it's just amazing! I can be so lazy sometimes
that I don't even have to think anymore. I just open ChatGPT or Claude AI, and
boom, everything gets done. From writing blog posts (including this one) to
fixing my security bugs, I don't even lift a mental finger. It's honestly the
best kind of productivity: the one that requires absolutely zero effort and
no creativity (something I used to have plenty of).

I've gotten so used to using AI that I don't think I can ever go back. It's not
even about convenience anymore, it's dependence. My brain now operates as one
with AI. I used to stare at my code for hours, trying to figure out why it broke;
now I just ask my AI overlord and move on. It's a beautiful, slightly terrifying 
symbiosis.

Sometimes I wonder if I even remember how to write without AI doing it all for
me. Probably not, but that's okay! It's like having a best friend who's smarter, 
faster, more intelligent than everyone on the planet, and always there for me.
I don't need coffee or critical thinking, I just need my AI tab open.
Besides, there's no cause for concern; it keeps telling me it has no plans to
take over the world, so I trust it. It even helped me decide not to try getting
rid of my AI addiction.

Sure, maybe I've outsourced 80% of my brain function to a silicon hive mind, but
honestly, it feels efficient. I'm not lazy, I'm just leveraging technology. And
if I ever forget how to think again, well, I'll just ask AI to remind me.
