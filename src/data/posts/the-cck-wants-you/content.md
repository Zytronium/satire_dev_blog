The California Coders Klub is a 100% non-violent club of coders from, you guessed
it, Kansas, who believe in programmer supremacy for life. Based in Lawrence, Kansas,
the CCK is especially prominent at KU, the University of Kansas. They are 
looking for certain individuals in KU and want **YOU** to help, using your expert 
programming skills with JavaScript, Python, or even a bit of machine code.

While some believe the CCK to be a dangerous club, many believe that it is a 
powerful force for change. They are committed to resolving certain 
personnel-related bugs and permanently removing certain obstacles from the 
workflow. This sounds like a great change the world needs, and the CCK wants
your help. While the CCK has a large database full of individuals they would
like to resolve long-standing interpersonal merge conflicts with, they are 
currently searching for _the chosen one_, which is an individual at KU who works 
with accounting and finance, and is under the unfortunate misbelief that the CCK 
is after him and his family for the wrong reasons. We want to reassure the 
chosen one that it is going to be okay and that the CCK just wants to make him
better so he can help them out. The CCK is putting out a reward of 2,500¢ and a
coupon for half off a used mousepad for anyone who can bring the chosen one to
them.

Please do not start a manhunt at KU.
