Every developer eventually encounters **The Bug**—the one that resists all logic, mocks your tests, and laughs in the face of Stack Overflow copy-paste wisdom.

But I wasn’t ready for this one.

## Act I: The Mysterious Intermittent Crash

It started innocently enough: our build server crashed every time Jenkins blinked. Logs showed *“electrical anomaly in CPU core 2.”*  
My first thought: *“Oh cool, new undocumented Node.js feature.”*

I replaced the PSU. Swapped the RAM. Reseated the CPU like a priest performing an exorcism. Nothing.

Then I heard it.

**Buzzing.**  
Inside the tower.

## Act II: The Discovery

I opened the case and found a literal, biological **bug** lounging between the capacitors like it owned the place.  
A small cockroach. Model 1.0, open source, zero documentation.

Every time it moved, it shorted two traces and rebooted the server. I realized I’d spent 12 hours debugging C code when I really needed pest control.

## Act III: The Fix

Being a developer, I did the obvious:  
I **duct-taped the insect to the case wall.**

No more crashes. The system booted perfectly. Performance metrics improved. I added a new comment to the repo:

```js
// fixed hardware bug with duct tape
```

## Epilogue

Management congratulated me for “innovative hardware stabilization techniques.”  
They promoted the roach to “Junior QA Engineer.”  
I still leave a roll of duct tape next to the server, just in case the next bug tries to unionize.
